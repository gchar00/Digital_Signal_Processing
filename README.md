# Digital Signal Processing

## Project Overview

This repository contains two laboratory exercises from the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course during the academic year 2022-2023. The labs focus on key concepts in signal processing, including spectral analysis, telephone tone detection, and perceptual audio coding using Python.

## Lab 1: Spectral Analysis and Telephone Tone Detection

**Objective:**  
This lab introduces digital signal processing techniques using Python, focusing on spectral analysis with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the detection of telephone tones (DTMF).

**Key Tasks:**
1. **Spectral Analysis using DFT:**  
   Analyze the spectral content of sinusoidal signals using the DFT and explore the effect of different window lengths on frequency resolution.
2. **Telephone Tone Detection (DTMF):**  
   Develop a system to detect which telephone key was pressed based on dual-tone signals using the DFT.

## Lab 2: Perceptual Audio Coding

**Objective:**  
In this lab, the goal is to compress an audio signal based on human auditory perception, focusing on critical frequency bands and psychoacoustic masking models.

**Key Tasks:**
1. **Psychoacoustic Model:**  
   Implement a perceptual audio coding model that takes advantage of psychoacoustic phenomena to reduce the size of audio files while preserving sound quality.
2. **Filterbank Analysis:**  
   Use filterbanks to analyze and reconstruct the signal, compressing the audio file and maintaining minimal perceptual loss.
